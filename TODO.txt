Ideas:
- Remove "Recycle bin context menu item"
- Add more optional columns like "date of deactivation"
  - Add popup menu like in Windows Explorer to show or hide them
- When disabling ShellNew item and updating related software ShellNew item gets usually registered again (ShellNew and _ShellNew exist in same key)
  --> Disable ShellNew again (but first remove _ShellNew)
- Add support for more shell extension types like "property sheets"
- Show icons of contextmenu items
- Add caption for ShellNew items
- Add support for editing file paths of Shell Cascading items
- Two execution modes
  - Admin: Read and edit all items (like now)
  - User: Read and edit only items owned by user
- Visual grouping
- Add "Execute" to popup menu
- Context menu: support cascading shell submenus (ExtendedSubCommandsKey)
- Receive notifications about registry changes
- New feature: shell bags cleaning
- "Import backup" supports merging existing items (especially scheduled tasks)
