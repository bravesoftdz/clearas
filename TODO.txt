Ideas:
- Add items to listview async
  - Allow editing at same time
- Export erasable items before deleting
- Visual grouping
- Add "Execute" to popup menu
- Context menu: support cascading shell submenus (ExtendedSubCommandsKey)
- Receive notifications about registry changes
- New feature: shell bags cleaning
- "Import backup" supports merging existing items (especially scheduled tasks)
