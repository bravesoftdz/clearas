Ideas:
- Remove "Recycle bin context menu item"
- Two execution modes
  - Admin: Read and edit all items (like now)
  - User: Read and edit only items owned by user
- Add items to listview async
  - Allow editing at same time
- Export erasable items before deleting
- Visual grouping
- Add "Execute" to popup menu
- Context menu: support cascading shell submenus (ExtendedSubCommandsKey)
- Receive notifications about registry changes
- New feature: shell bags cleaning
- "Import backup" supports merging existing items (especially scheduled tasks)
