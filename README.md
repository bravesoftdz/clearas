Clearas
=======

Clearas is a cleansing program to edit autostart, context menu, service and scheduled task items. It started as reimplementation of the msconfig tool with inspirations from CCleaner. Now it is an open-source cleansing program for advanced users who want the ability to manage autostart, context menu, service and scheduled task items in a more flexible way with enhanced possibilities.
